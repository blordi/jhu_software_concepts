Created by Benjamin Lordi for Modern Software Concepts in Python - 8.29.25
## About
This is the Module 1 Assignment Personal Website for the Modern Software Concepts in Python class.

I created a website using Flask as the framework. The pages are created from templates using the blueprint function in flask.

The HTML and CSS were created with help from Claude Sonnet 4.  I relied on the examples and instruction from 
https://realpython.com/flask-project/ throughout the project.

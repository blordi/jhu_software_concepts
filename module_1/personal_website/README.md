Created by Benjamin Lordi for Modern Software Concepts in Python - 8.29.25
## About
This is the Module 1 Assignment Personal Website for the Modern Software Concepts in Python class.

A personal website with a home, contact, and projects showcase page.
The Flaks application uses blueprints and templates for organization. There are three included pages:

--**Home**: An about me section with a profile picture.

--**Projects**: A collection of projects from Modern Software Concepts in Python.

The HTML and CSS were created with help from Claude Sonnet 4.
I relied on the examples and instruction from 
https://realpython.com/flask-project/ throughout the project.
